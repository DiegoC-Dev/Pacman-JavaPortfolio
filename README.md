# Pacman java-portfolio
A Java adaptation of the classic Pacman game, developed using the Model-View-Presenter pattern and the Singleton pattern for unique ghost behavior. It employs logical and graphical threads for animations and object collision events. The graphics are pixel-based, created using Javaâ€™s basic tools. The game includes sound effects for key events like death, game start, and victory, and features control via arrow keys.
